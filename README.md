# speed-evaluation-of-Cryptographic-operations-

This project is to simulate and evalute the performance of different cryptographic libraries : AES, DSA, RSA and hash <br />
hash algorithms evaluated : sha256, sha512, sha3_256 <br />
AES implemented for CBC and CTR mode for key sizes 128bit and 256bit <br />
DSA implemented for key sizes 2048bit and 3072bit <br />
RSA implemented for key sizes 2048bit and 3072bit <br />
 
The simulation is run for files of different sizes 1kb, 1mb and 10mb. It can either be generated using string of random characters or <br />
a pre-existing files of correspoding sizes.

How to run: <br />
-Download all the files in the repo in a linux distro or any linux virtual environment, <br />
-run the script 'crytotools'    ./cryptotools <br />
-Make use of 'makefile' to install libraries if not already existing.
